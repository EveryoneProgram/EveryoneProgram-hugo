Everyone has their own learning style and speed. We adapt to yours using online
self-paced tutorials. You move as fast or as slowly as you feel comfortable. If
you get stuck or have questions, we have coaches to help.

Practice Before Theory
----------------------

You begin coding right away, taking small steps with the hands-on tutorials.
Once you get some experience, you have a context for questions, discussions and
ideas.

â€‹This approach works well for most people, but for folks who like a more
traditional lecture-first strategy, we point you to free online lectures.

Do What Works for You
---------------------

Regular meetings are organized using an online tool (Doodle) to create
locations and times that work for more folks. We will attempt weekly meetings,
but this will vary according to needs and schedules.

If you're happy working on your own, the resources in this site will guide your
self-study. If you start getting stuck, you can always join a meeting.
