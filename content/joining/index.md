You can join at any time -- we have no official starting date and there is no
"course schedule." You start wherever you are, and move forward at your own pace.

If you can't make every meeting, that's fine. Just pick up where you left off.

To Sign Up for Meetings
-----------------------

- Join the [Email Group](http://groups.google.com/group/everyone-program)
(click on "Subscribe to this group"). Meetings (including location, which may
vary) will be announced through this group.

What You Need
-------------

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux. Chromebooks should also work, although
  we haven't tried one yet). If you don't have one, contact us and
  we can usually find something.

- If you're working on your own, an Internet connection. The meeting locations
  will always have Internet.
