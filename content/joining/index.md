To Sign Up for Meetings
-----------------------

- Join the [Email Group](http://groups.google.com/group/everyone-program)
(click on "Subscribe to this group"). Meetings (including location, which may
vary) will be announced through this group.

What You Need
-------------

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux. Chromebooks should also work, although
  we haven't tried one yet). If you don't have one, contact us and
  we can usually find something.

- If you're working on your own, an Internet connection. The meeting locations
  will always have Internet.
