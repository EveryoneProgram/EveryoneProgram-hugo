Here are the three free online tutorials we'll be using. They are all chosen to
ease you into programming in the gentlest way possible. There's no rush --
you'll work at whatever pace you're most comfortable with, and during the
meetings we'll have one or more coaches available if you get stuck.

1.  To get you going in the easiest way possible, we'll start with
[CodeAcademy's Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). This
requires no setup at all, and will quickly show you what programming feels
like.

2.  Next you'll get a bit more depth with [Learn Python the Hard
Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/). Don't be fooled by the
title -- it's actually one of the easier introductions to the language.

3.  Finally you'll work your way through the [DjangoGirls
Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) and learn to build a
programmable web site. This tutorial is legendary for its friendliness and
simplicity. The lessons in the tutorial also include links to associated
videos.

4. At this point we can direct you to further learning resources depending on
your interests; for example you might want to start programming MineCraft or
explore the "Internet of Things" using MicroPython. Or you might have a special
project you'd like to tackle.
