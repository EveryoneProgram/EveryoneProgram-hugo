Many people find the tutorials by themselves work fine. However, some folks
prefer starting with video lectures before tackling the tutorial exercises.

We've found the free
[Socratica](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-)
series of lectures to be straightforward and useful. They follow a similar (not exact)
order as the [Tutorials].

The code examples in these videos generally use large enough fonts that you can
even watch them on your phone, if you have young eyes.

Note that the Socratica videos seem to have a science-fiction theme in their
artwork, and the speaker gives the impression that she might be an android.
This, however, gives her an excuse for speaking very clearly and precisely.
